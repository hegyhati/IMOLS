<h2>Modeling in general</h2>

<p>
  Modeling is a technique used in many fields with different purposes, such as simulation, planning, and of course, optimization.
  A model is essentially a simplified version of something real, which is easier, cheaper to deal with.
  A model is not necessarily a mathematical one, a mock-up can be thought of as a physical model.
  On this site, however, the word <em>model</em> will always refer to a mathematical model, unless specified otherwise.  
</p>

<p>
  There are many things, that could serve as a model.
  The simplest ones are thought in secondary school physics classes, e.g., \( v=\frac{s}{t} \), where <var>v</var> denotes the average velocity if the distance <var>s</var> is covered within <var>t</var> time.
  This model is a simple equation between 3 <em>variables</em>.
  Other models may employ different mathematical structures, such as graphs.
  In this course, we will focus on algebraic models as discussed below.
</p>

<p>
  It is important to note, that in most of the cases, a model is only a "simplification" of a real life phenomena.
  Usually, the model disregards some parameters, that may influence the behavior of a system.
  In the above example, it was assumed, that the object moved along a straight line.
  When a real life problem emerges, the modeler has a great responsibility in selecting the parameters to be included into model, and the level of detail, how they are represented.
</p>

<p>
  This can be very well presented on the evolution of GPS navigation tools.
  The basic problem is simple, we want to get from point A to point B as fast as possible.
  <ol>
    <li>
      The simplest approach to apply is to find the shortest path between the locations.
      This could be done easily, if the weighted graph of the road network is available.
    </li>
    <li>
      A bit more advanced approach would be, if we would take into account the speed limit on each part of the road, and replace the distances in the graph with the minimal travel time needed.
      Computationally speaking, this approach requires the same resources, however, more input data is required.
    </li>
    <li>
      Most of the modern navigation systems, that run on devices with internet connection go a step further, and use real time traffic data to consider while planning a trip.
    </li>
  </ol>
  We could even go further by including weather data, road conditions, characteristics of the driver, etc.
  As we include more and more parameters, the model becomes more and more accurate, but also more difficult to handle.
</p>

<div class="alert alert-primary">
  In general, the goal is to find a model, which
  <ol>
    <li>can be solved/simulated/etc. with the available computing resources in a reasonable amount of time</li>
    <li>can provide results, that are accurate enough to be relevant for the original real life problem</li>
    <li>requires only such data, that can be provided</li>
  </ol>
</div>

<p>
  Later on, we will not focus on this very first step of modeling, and we will assume, that these decisions are already made, and we just have to construct and solve the appropriate mathematical model.

<h2>Model for the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/pages/froccs.html">Fröccs example</a></h2>

<p>
  Let us assume, that we have a solution.
  Not necessarily optimal, but any solution.
  The solution entails, how much we sell from different kinds of beverages.
  Let \(x_{KF}\) denote the number of portions we sell from kisfröccs,  \(x_{NF}\) the number of portions for nagyfröccs, and so on. 
</p>

<p>
  Based on these values, we can calculate, how much wine was needed for this solution in a simple way.
  For \(x_{KF}\) portions of kisfröccs \(x_{KF}\cdot 1\) dl of wine is needed.
  Similarly,  \(x_{NF}\cdot 2\) dl of wine had to be used for \(x_{NF}\) portions of nagyfröccs.
  Following this logic, the total amount of wine used in deciliters is:
  \[1 \cdot x_{KF} + 2 \cdot x_{NF}\ + 1 \cdot x_{HL} + 3 \cdot x_{HM} + 2 \cdot x_{VHM} + 9 \cdot x_{KrF} + 1 \cdot x_{SF} + 6 \cdot x_{PF}\]
</p>

<p>
  The stock for wines is 100 litres = 1000 deciliters, so, whatever those values are, the following inequality must hold in a good solution:
  \[1 \cdot x_{KF} + 2 \cdot x_{NF}\ + 1 \cdot x_{HL} + 3 \cdot x_{HM} + 2 \cdot x_{VHM} + 9 \cdot x_{KrF} + 1 \cdot x_{SF} + 6 \cdot x_{PF} \le 1000\]
</p>

<p>
  A very similar <emph>constraint</emph> could be constructed for the soda as well:
  \[1 \cdot x_{KF} + 1 \cdot x_{NF}\ + 2 \cdot x_{HL} + 2 \cdot x_{HM} + 3 \cdot x_{VHM} + 1 \cdot x_{KrF} + 9 \cdot x_{SF} + 3 \cdot x_{PF} \le 1500\]
</p>

<p>
  If the values for \(x_{KF}, x_{NF}, \dots\) are selected from the \([0,\infty[\) interval so, that the two inequalities above are satisfied, then that solution is feasible and good.
  We have now a simple algebraic model for the restrictions of the model.
  The only thing missing is to express our objective.
</p>

<p>
  Similarly to the wine and soda usage, the profit attained with such a plan is:
  \[110 \cdot x_{KF} + 200 \cdot x_{NF}\ + 120 \cdot x_{HL} + 260 \cdot x_{HM} + 200 \cdot x_{VHM} + 800 \cdot x_{KrF} + 200 \cdot x_{SF} + 550 \cdot x_{PF}\]
  And this is, what we want to maximize.
</p>

<p>
  Now, if we put together everything, we get:
</p>

<div class="alert alert-success">
  \[x_{KF},x_{NF},x_{HL},x_{HM},x_{VHM},x_{KrF},x_{SF},x_{PF} \in [0,\infty[ \]
  <br>
  \[1 \cdot x_{KF} + 2 \cdot x_{NF}\ + 1 \cdot x_{HL} + 3 \cdot x_{HM} + 2 \cdot x_{VHM} + 9 \cdot x_{KrF} + 1 \cdot x_{SF} + 6 \cdot x_{PF} \le 1000\]
  \[1 \cdot x_{KF} + 1 \cdot x_{NF}\ + 2 \cdot x_{HL} + 2 \cdot x_{HM} + 3 \cdot x_{VHM} + 1 \cdot x_{KrF} + 9 \cdot x_{SF} + 3 \cdot x_{PF} \le 1500\]
  <hr />
  \[110 \cdot x_{KF} + 200 \cdot x_{NF}\ + 120 \cdot x_{HL} + 260 \cdot x_{HM} + 200 \cdot x_{VHM} + 800 \cdot x_{KrF} + 200 \cdot x_{SF} + 550 \cdot x_{PF} \to max\]
</div>
