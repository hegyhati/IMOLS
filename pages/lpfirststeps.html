<h2>Modeling in general</h2>

<p>
  Modeling is a technique used in many fields with different purposes, such as simulation, planning, and of course, optimization.
  A model is essentially a simplified version of something real, which is easier, cheaper to deal with.
  A model is not necessarily a mathematical one, a mock-up can be thought of as a physical model.
  On this site, however, the word <em>model</em> will always refer to a mathematical model, unless specified otherwise.

<p>
  There are many things, that could serve as a model.
  The simplest ones are thought in secondary school physics classes, e.g., \( v=\frac{s}{t} \), where <var>v</var> denotes the average velocity if the distance <var>s</var> is covered within <var>t</var> time.
  This model is a simple equation between 3 <em>variables</em>.
  Other models may employ different mathematical structures, such as graphs.
  In this course, we will focus on algebraic models as discussed below.
